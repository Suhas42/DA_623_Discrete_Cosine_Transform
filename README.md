# DA_623_Discrete_Cosine_Transform
This Jupyter Notebook-based tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Discrete Cosine Transform, a widely used technique in signal processing and data compression.

In this tutorial, we will cover the fundamentals of the DCT, its mathematical representation, applications in image and signal processing, as well as practical implementation examples using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy.
